# The ThreeTeeth Browser

A simple web browser for Windows based on the Microsoft Trident engine. It was
originally released on zetacentauri.com as the Zeta MiniBrowser, later renamed
to The ThreeTeeth Browser and hosted on threeteeth.com. It was downloaded more
than 15,000 times before being open-sourced.

A prebuilt Windows installer is available in the Installer directory:

# Development Status

I stopped developing this software back in 2013. It probably does not behave like
a modern web browser. I may or may not decide to update and/or maintain it, but
for now it should be considered "abandonware". The original domain it was
hosted on has long since expired and is now owned by a squatter, so the
"search" page is worthless.
